        "This Jupyter Notebook is associated with the paper titled \"Hidden in Time, Revealed in Frequency: Spectral Features and Multiresolution Analysis for Encrypted Internet Traffic Classification,\" presented at the IEEE CCNC 2024 Conference. The research addresses the challenge of classifying encrypted internet traffic, introducing two novel methods: STFT-TC (Short-Time Fourier Transform-Based Traffic Classifier) and DWT-TC (Discrete Wavelet Transform-Based Traffic Classifier). These methods utilize time-frequency analysis techniques to provide improved accuracy and insight in encrypted traffic classification, demonstrating significant advancements over existing approaches.\n",
